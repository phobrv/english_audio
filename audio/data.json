He felt nervous. \u201cIn 3-2-1 go!\u201d the waiter said. Roberto started eating. The first ten bites were good, but then he started to get sick. The crowd kept cheering and that motivated Roberto. Nine minutes had passed and Roberto was down to his last bite. He took the last piece and swallowed it. The crowd cheered. Roberto felt proud.
